<p id="texto1-1">  
Did you ever happen to wake up and feel the need to drink coffee, but you don't
want to prepare it or go and buy some?
We are sleepy coffee, our company is creating an application that lets you have
coffee the way and hour you find convenient you just need to connect your app to
your coffee maker, set up your profile and go to sleep. The app works as an alarm,
so when you turn off the alarm your coffee will start to make. By the time you are
ready to go you just simply take your coffee.

</p>
    
<p id="texto2">   
Sleepy coffee will be an application that let you have fresh coffee every morning
without the need of making it yourself. This app works in a really simple way, the app
works as an alarm, and when you turn off the alarm the coffee maker that is
connected to your app will start to prepare your coffee. By the time you are ready to
go you can simply take it and leave. We know that not everyone likes their coffee
the same way, so sleepy coffee lets you create profiles and configure every one with
different needs, like: temperature of the coffee, how strong you like to drink it, the
time you take approximate to be ready and how much sugar you like on it.
