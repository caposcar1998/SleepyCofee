          of the app, a little overloaded too. Try using transparent images and
          cleaning up the design of the page. Link your logo to the landingpage.

        <li>Starting time 12:25, ending time: 12:33</li>

        <li>Good slide design.</li>

        <!--
          <li>Note: it is not incomplete because it's a prototype as you mentioned, it is incomplete because it gives us information about the user first impression and first mental model. This model would probably evolve or change as the user gets more knowledge (just as the Messi example you correctly explained).</li>
        -->

        <!--
          <li>Good presentation, as I mentioned, it would have been great if you performed an actual model extraction test during the presentation.</li>
        -->

        <li>Good presentation. Your test was ok but you missed to record ;)</li>

        <!--
          <li>Watch for some presentation design issues, increase font size, increase contrast, display font at the top of the screen. Remember we have this huge displays in front of us and it's difficult to read the bottom part of the screen.</li>
        -->

        <!-- <li>First slide is already too cluttered.</li> -->

        <!-- <li>Cinthya: please talk a little louder.</li> -->

        <!-- <li>Good examples of Nielsen heuristics.</li> -->

        <!--
          <li>You missed to talk about some other heurstics. Please include the one from Shneiderman (8 golden rules).</li>
        -->

        <!--
          <li>If you can, add a "check list" of the Nielsen or Shneiderman heuristics that we could use for evaluating our designs.</li>
        -->

        <!--
          <li>You really got the idea of the technique right. Thanks.</li>
        -->

        <!--
          <li>It would have been amazing for you to actually perform a real evaluation of a real prototype or website using this technique live. </li>
        -->

        <!--
          <li>In the "How to" 2nd slide you have way too much text and the font size is too small. </li>
        -->

        <!--
          <li>It is usually better to have fewer text in the slides, some of your slides were too cluttered.</li>
        -->

        <!--
          <li>As a tip, always pre download any youtube video you wish to use. There were some technical (audio) delays.</li>
        -->

        <!-- <li>Video never played!</li> -->

        <!-- <li>Technical problems during the presentation.</li> -->

        <!--
          <li>The idea was NOT to present design frameworks, that was just a small part of the whole literature (think conferences for example).</li>
